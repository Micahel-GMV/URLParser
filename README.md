  This console application parses input file using dictionary and saves found words in output file. 
It uses self-written dictionary based on N-ary tree with some fun optimizations. User can specify 
quantity of simultanious parsing threads from 1 to 8. All processes and errors are logged.
Please look at the code and have a nice day!
Mike.
